						<p>You will not find a better income producing Orchard with such a diverse selection of fruits on three acres. There are 22 different fruits grown in the orchard. The "Taste the Fruits‚Äù section describes most of them.</p>

						<p>The main commercial crops are Mango, Longan and Lychee.</p>

						<p>Avocado, Dragon Fruit, Figs, and Malay Apple add a substantial amount to the harvest income too.</p>

						<p>The other minor fruits, Abiu, Caimito, Custard Apple, Sapodilla, Carambola, Jackfruit, Durian, Langsat, Rambutan, Papaya, Passion Fruit, citrus and Jaboticaba add to the mix and will play a part in being able to provide a wide selection of tropical fruit to fruit platters the boutique resorts supply to their guest upon arrival.</p>

						<p>Selections were chosen based on the Cook Islands weather conditions, proven commercial results in similar regions, and for their early, mid and late season harvesting times.</p>

						<p>The nine mango varieties imported can extend the harvest season up to six months. These include R2E2, Kent, Kensington, Keitt, Irwin, King Thai, Nam Dok Mai, Palmer and Zillate.</p>
